WHILE LOOP - CALCULATESUMOFNUMBERSBETWEEN

Using the while loop, implement the
CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween method, which given two
integers called firstNumber and lastNumber,should calculate the
sum of numbers between them (including the numbers themselves)

If lastNumber is smaller tha firstNumber, the result shall be 0.

For example:

    -   for firstNumber equal to 5 and lastNumber equal to 10,
        the result should be 45 because this is the sum of numbers 5, 6,
        7, 8, 9, 10

    -   for firstNumber equal to -5 and lastNumber equal to 5, 
        the result should be 0 because this is the sum of numberss -5, -4,
        -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

    -   for firstNumber equal to 10 and lastNumber equal to 10,
        the result should be 10 because, to the sum, we include
        the only number, which is 10

    -   for firstNumber equal to 5 and lastNumber equal to 4,
        the result should be 0 because the lastNumber is smaller than
        firstNumber
